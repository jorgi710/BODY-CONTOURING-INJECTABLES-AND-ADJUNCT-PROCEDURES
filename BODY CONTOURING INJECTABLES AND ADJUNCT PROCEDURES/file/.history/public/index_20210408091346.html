              Body sculpting procedures are one of the fastest growing segments
              of the medical aesthetic industry. Numerous procedures exist and
              are evolving to smooth, lift, tighten and sculpt body areas. No
              longer are patients only concerned with the appearance of their
              face, many patients of all ages are seeking ways to improve the
              appearance of various body part indications and need qualified
              providers to advise them on the best procedure for their
              particular issue and safely perform these procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
              This course is the culmination of all of the aesthetic procedures
              that Empire Medical Training teaches and will prepare you to apply
              what you have learned to the next level of aesthetic care in
              providing body contouring procedures. The course will benefit all
              practitioners (novice or advanced injectors) to safely inject
              Non-HA dermal fillers and biologics in a number of body part areas
              as well as combining and using other injectable techniques such as
              PDO Threads to create the very best outcomes for patients.

              smoothing will be demonstrated as an adjunct to the filler
              techniques. Combination therapies for fillers, PDO threads, PRP

              presented. Other treatments showcased during this 1-Day

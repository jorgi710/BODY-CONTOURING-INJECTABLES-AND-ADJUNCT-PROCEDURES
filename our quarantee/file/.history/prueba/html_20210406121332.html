                                <p><b>Russian Lip Techniques:</b> The HA product is injected vertically at the base of the lip and the dermal filler is injected retrograde drawing the projecting the product outward toward the lip border.  This allows the injector to inject the product from the inside out rather than from the lip border working inward – the results are completely natural and the results are amazing.</p>

                                <p><b>Microdroplet Technique:</b> Typically, this technique is utilized when you wish to utilize blunt tip cannulas to reduce the risk of bruising or vascular injury.  The technique requires anesthesia of the lips since you will typically inject 100-300 micro droplets to buttress the lip borders/edges, rejuvenate the philtrum (Cupid’s Bow) and inject every crease within the lip that cause lipstick blead.  The results look completely natural and enhances the overall features of the lip.</p>

                                <p><b>Lip Tenting (Pillar) Technique:</b> Similar to the Russian Lip Technique, enhancement of the lip is achieved by injecting the lip vertically from the white roll (vermillion border) of the lip using serial punctures by retro injection.  This technique allows for more control over the amount of filler used as well as better control of the shape of the lip compared to serial threading that is parallel to the contour of the lip.  This is the simplest and easiest way to augment the lips of patients that may be asymmetrical, have lip pockets, or to correct the work of others.</p>

                                <p><b>Separation Technique:</b> This technique is utilized when rounding the areas of the upper and lower lip to create the correct look when the lips are closed.  Additionally, this technique is applied when creating the “keyhole” look to lips.</p>

                                <p><b>Cross Hatching Technique:</b> Though this technique is very common for other types of dermal filler injections, learn when to use this technique in the lips to achieve the desired effect and for the type of look the patient is desiring.</p>

                                <p><b>Advanced Fanning Technique: </b> Similar to other techniques used for parallel serial injections, learn how these advanced fanning injections will change the shaping of the lip to the desired look.  The techniques shown will be for both needle and microcannula with descriptions as to entry points and pearls to achieve these results.</p>
